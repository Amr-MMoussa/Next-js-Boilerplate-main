Badges and quick links
- Releases: [![Releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/Releases-Download-blue?logo=github&style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/Amr-MMoussa/Next-js-Boilerplate-main/releases)
- Use the Releases page to download the packaged installer or build artifacts. Pick the asset that matches your needs and run the included setup script.

Quick start (Local) ‚öôÔ∏è
1. Download the release asset from the Releases page:
   - Choose the asset named nextjs-boilerplate-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz or nextjs-boilerplate-vX.Y.Z.zip.
   - Extract the archive and run the installer script that ships with the release (example below).
2. Or clone the repo for development:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Amr-MMoussa/Next-js-Boilerplate-main.git
cd Next-js-Boilerplate-main
pnpm install          # or npm install / yarn
cp .env.example .env.local
pnpm dev              # starts the dev server
```
3. If you downloaded the release package:
```bash
# example commands, adjust for the specific asset name
tar -xzf nextjs-boilerplate-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz
cd nextjs-boilerplate
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
The release asset includes an installer script. Run the script to scaffold local config and install dependencies.

Environment variables
- Copy the example env file to create your local config:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```
- Edit .env.local with your values:
  - DATABASE_URL - connection string for your DB.
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN - Sentry DSN for client reports.
  - SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN - server-side Sentry token.

- start ‚Äî start server from production build.
- lint ‚Äî run ESLint.
- format ‚Äî run Prettier.
- test ‚Äî run tests with Vitest.

Testing and quality
- Unit tests: Vitest + Testing Library.
- E2E: Playwright with example tests.
- Storybook: component catalog with knobs and examples.
- Linting: ESLint configured for Next + TypeScript.
- Formatting: Prettier with shared rules.
- Pre-commit: Husky runs Lint-Staged to check files.

Database and Drizzle ORM
- Use Drizzle for typed queries and migrations.
- Migrations live in /db/migrations.
- Run migrations:
```bash
pnpm migrate
```
- Seed the database:
```bash
pnpm seed
```
- The example uses SQLite for local dev by default. Update DATABASE_URL for Postgres or MySQL.

CI and Git hooks
- CI workflows in .github/workflows include:
  - lint
  - test
  - e2e
  - storybook build
- Husky hooks run on commit and push for lint and test checks.
- Commitlint enforces conventional commits.

Storybook and UI dev
- Start Storybook:
```bash
pnpm storybook
```
- Build Storybook for a static site:
```bash
pnpm build-storybook
```
- Use stories for design reviews and component QA.

Playwright
- Playwright lives in /playwright with sample tests.
- Run Playwright:
```bash
pnpm e2e
```
- CI uses Playwright to run tests against a headless browser.

Sentry integration
- Client and server integrate with Sentry when DSN is provided.
- Add NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN to .env.local for frontend traces.
- Add SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN and other server vars for server-side uploads.

VSCode and developer setup
- .vscode recommends extensions for ESLint, Prettier, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.
- Workspace settings lock editor.formatOnSave and formatter settings.
- Use the included devcontainer for consistent local dev in Docker.

Customization checklist
- Replace placeholder names and metadata in package.json.
- Update scripts to fit your deploy model.
- Pick your database and update DATABASE_URL.
- Adjust Tailwind config for your design tokens.
- Add Sentry DSN and other secrets via your CI secret store.

Contributing üõ†Ô∏è
- Follow the commit message guidelines enforced by Commitlint.
- Run tests and linters before opening a PR.
- Use the issue templates for bug reports and feature requests.
- Add small, focused changes. Write tests when you add logic.
